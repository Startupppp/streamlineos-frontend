/**
 * Every `check:*` script in package.json must be invoked by a real `run:` step of a real job in
 * `.github/workflows/`, or be listed here with a reason.
 *
 * Written 2026-09-03 after measuring that TEN gates across the two repositories existed in
 * package.json and were referenced by no workflow at all — among them
 * `check:permission-binding`, which had found 27 real permission/route mismatches on the day it
 * was written, and `check:tenant-isolation:run`, which is the gate that actually EXECUTES the
 * cross-tenant isolation suites.
 *
 * A gate that cannot run is indistinguishable from a gate that passes. That is the defect class
 * this release keeps finding — a budget whose SQL read a different table, a purge that verified
 * the wrong bucket, a ratchet whose workflow pointed at a directory that does not exist. This
 * closes the version of it that applies to gates themselves.
 *
 * An exception must carry a real reason. "Needs a live database" is one; "not yet" is not.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 2026-09-03 — THE MATCHER NO LONGER SEARCHES TEXT. It parses.
 *
 * This gate used to decide "wired" by asking whether the concatenated raw YAML *contained* the
 * gate's name. In the backend copy that failed in three distinct ways:
 *
 *   1. A gate named only in a `#` COMMENT counted as wired — `check:query-projections` was in
 *      package.json, in no run step and in no exception list, while this gate reported
 *      "96 gates, all wired".
 *   2. A workflow file that DID NOT PARSE AT ALL still reported every gate in it as wired.
 *      `ci.yml` carried a step name containing ": " — a plain YAML scalar may not — so GitHub
 *      loaded nothing from the file and all 96 gates in it were dead.
 *   3. A gate whose only mention was its own `:self-test` counted as wired, because the gate
 *      name is a prefix of it. A self-test asserts the DETECTOR against planted defects; it
 *      never reads the repository. Two backend gates were live in exactly that state.
 *
 * All three are the same shape: the evidence was text near the thing, not the thing. So the
 * matcher now walks `jobs.<id>.steps[].run` of a parsed document and compares whole shell
 * tokens. A comment, a commented-out step, a step under `if: false`, a `name:` that merely
 * mentions the gate, and an unparseable file all fail — the last of them loudly, by file and
 * parse error, because that is how an entire CI file went dead unnoticed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 2026-09-03 (later the same day) — PARSING IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER. THE WORKFLOW MUST BE REACHABLE.
 *
 * Ported from the backend copy, which found the fourth instance of the class. `db-gates.yml`
 * parsed, named its gates in real `run:` steps, and that gate reported all of them wired — while
 * the file carried `on: { schedule, workflow_dispatch }` and nothing else, so no push and no pull
 * request had ever run one. Its entire Actions history was ONE scheduled run, and all three jobs
 * failed at the first database step, unread.
 *
 * `run:` membership is therefore necessary and not sufficient. A workflow contributes its steps
 * only when GitHub will start it WITHOUT a human: no `on:` at all, an empty one, only
 * `workflow_dispatch`/`repository_dispatch`, a `schedule:` with no cron, or a push/pull_request
 * `branches:` filter matching no branch this repository has, each make it UNREACHABLE and fail
 * this gate by name. A job pinned `if: false` (or `if: ${{ false }}`) is a DEAD JOB and its steps
 * leave the corpus. And an UNWIRED_BY_DESIGN reason that names a workflow is checked against that
 * workflow's `run:` steps, because a reason that is not true launders a dead gate as a choice.
 *
 * `frontend.yml` fires on push to `main` and on pull request, so it is reachable and this repo's
 * numbers are unchanged by the check. It is here so the property cannot regress silently.

 * Added 2026-09-03 (v2 ticket 30). Until now this gate answered one question — is the gate
 * NAMED by a run: step of a reachable job — and treated that as "wired". It is not the same
 * question. A step carrying `continue-on-error: true` runs, prints, and then reports success
 * whatever it found: GitHub records the job as passing and the red is a grey annotation nobody
 * reads. Measured at head across the two repositories: 18 gate steps carried that flag, and six
 * of them exit 2 (INCONCLUSIVE, prerequisite absent) and 1 (a real defect) INDISTINGUISHABLY,
 * so a genuine finding could never fail CI. A gate that cannot fail is exactly the defect class
 * this file exists to close, and it was invisible to the file itself.
 *
 * `continue-on-error` on the JOB counts too: it makes every step in it non-blocking.
 *
 * An entry must name a MEASURED reason and an owner, the same discipline as UNWIRED_BY_DESIGN.
 * "flaky" and "not yet" are not reasons. The correct fix for a prerequisite-blocked gate is
 * usually not this list: it is to let the step distinguish exit 2 (prerequisite absent, warn)
 * from exit 1 (real finding, fail), which keeps the bite and still tolerates a missing sibling
