/**
 * Every `check:*` script in package.json must be referenced by a workflow, or be listed here
 * with a reason.
 *
 * Written 2026-09-03 after measuring that TEN gates across the two repositories existed in
 * package.json and were referenced by no workflow at all — among them
 * `check:permission-binding`, which had found 27 real permission/route mismatches on the day it
 * was written, and `check:tenant-isolation:run`, which is the gate that actually EXECUTES the
 * cross-tenant isolation suites.
 *
 * A gate that cannot run is indistinguishable from a gate that passes. That is the defect class
 * this release keeps finding — a budget whose SQL read a different table, a purge that verified
 * the wrong bucket, a ratchet whose workflow pointed at a directory that does not exist. This
 * closes the version of it that applies to gates themselves.
 *
 * An exception must carry a real reason. "Needs a live database" is one; "not yet" is not.
