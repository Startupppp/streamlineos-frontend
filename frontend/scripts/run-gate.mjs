/**
 * Run one gate and tell a MISSING PREREQUISITE apart from a REAL FINDING.
 *
 * Written 2026-09-03 for v2 ticket 30 (PRD-C011/C015/C104).
 *
 * Every cross-repository gate in this project already distinguishes the two by exit code:
 *   0  the rule was checked and holds
 *   1  the rule was checked and is VIOLATED — a real finding
 *   2  the rule could not be checked — INCONCLUSIVE, a named prerequisite is absent
 *      (see check-repo-paths.mjs `reportBackendUnreachable`)
 *
 * CI threw that distinction away. Eight frontend and ten backend steps carried
 * `continue-on-error: true`, which swallows 1 and 2 identically: the job goes green, the red is
 * a grey annotation, and a genuine violation can be merged straight past. Measured at head:
 * six of those gates exit 2 in the single-repository checkout CI performs and 1 when they find
 * a defect, and no one could have told which had happened from the job status.
 *
 * This runner keeps the tolerance and restores the bite. Exit 2 becomes a visible GitHub
 * warning annotation and a passing step; every other non-zero code fails the step, and the job.
 *
 * It is deliberately Node and not a shell snippet. PRD-C015 requires the harness to run on
 * Windows, macOS and Linux; `set +e ... $?` is bash-only and silently mis-reports under
 * PowerShell, which is the default shell on a windows-latest runner.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/run-gate.mjs <package-script> [more-scripts...] --prerequisite "<what is absent>"
 *   node scripts/run-gate.mjs --self-test
 *
 * Multiple scripts run in order and stop at the first failure, so it composes the
 * `<gate>:self-test && <gate>` pairing the workflows already use.
