/**
 * Numbers that are structurally valid and obviously not anybody's.
 *
 * `9999999999` passes every shape check an Indian mobile has: ten digits,
 * leading 6–9, correct length for the +91 plan. A library that checks the
 * numbering plan says yes, and QA typed exactly that into org setup and was let
 * through. Nothing downstream ever calls the number, so the organisation carries
 * a contact that cannot be reached and nobody finds out until someone tries.
 *
 * This is not verification — only an OTP is verification, and the product does
 * not send one here. It is the cheap half: refusing the placeholder people type
 * when a form demands a number they do not want to give.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. A run like 9876543210 is just as obviously a placeholder,
 * and it was rejected here for a while — but it is also a number the numbering
 * plan can allocate, and the cost of being wrong is turning a real customer away
 * at signup. One digit repeated ten times cannot be anybody's, so that is where
 * the line sits.
 *
 * Deliberately duplicated from the backend's
 * `src/common/validation/implausible-phone.ts` rather than shared: the two repos
 * have no shared package, and a wizard that only learns its number is refused
 * after a round trip is the worse failure. The backend copy is the authority;
 * this one exists so the message appears under the field as it is typed. Both
 * carry the same cases in their tests.
