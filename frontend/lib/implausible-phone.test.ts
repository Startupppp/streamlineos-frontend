/**
 * HRMS-E2E-019. QA typed 9999999999 into org setup and was let through. Every
 * shape rule an Indian mobile has says yes to it — ten digits, leading 9,
 * correct length for the +91 plan — and the product sends no OTP here, so
 * nothing downstream would ever have found out. The organisation simply carries
 * a contact nobody answers.
 *
 * This file mirrors the backend's `implausible-phone.spec.ts` case for case.
 * The two copies of the rule have no shared package between them, so the tests
 * are what keeps them saying the same thing.
