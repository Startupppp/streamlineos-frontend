    <p>Dear ${employeeName},</p>

    <p>This is to formally notify you that your performance over the past two months
    (from ${PERIOD_FROM} to ${PERIOD_TO}) has been below the expected standards.</p>

    <p>Despite being provided with adequate time, support, and clear targets, you have
    not met the assigned sales expectations. This is a matter of serious concern and
    cannot be overlooked.</p>

    <p>As per the terms discussed at the time of your joining, the initial two months
    were considered a full salary period. Post completion of this period, due to your
    failure to meet the required performance benchmarks, your compensation will now be
    revised to a basic salary of <strong>&#8377;${salary} per month</strong>, effective
    immediately.</p>

    <p>You are hereby advised to show immediate and measurable improvement in your
    performance. Failure to meet targets going forward will result in further strict
    action, which may include a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) or other
    disciplinary measures.</p>

    <p>Consider this as an official warning. Your performance will be closely monitored
    on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>For any clarification, you may contact your reporting manager.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:32px;">Regards,<br/>Human Resources<br/>Vaivamm Capital</p>
