# Bugs and verification ledger

Status: Current unverified historical findings; Planned remediation

## Problem Statement

Planning a fix is not evidence that a historical browser failure is resolved. Pack observations also change over time: PM-001 first described no CTA, then Owner verification showed CTAs existed with failed persistence/loader. Preserve chronology and current uncertainty.

## Solution

Retain source evidence, map findings to canonical interfaces, and close only on current actor-specific persisted behavior. Refer to [research traceability](./research-traceability.md) for all source IDs and screenshots.

## User Stories

1. As an owner, I want an invitation to yield real access, so that collaborators start without support.
2. As a client, I want a successful grant to open my project, so that success messages are trustworthy.
3. As a Member, I want assigned projects visible, so that a blank list does not resemble data loss.
4. As an administrator, I want revocation to stop reads and jobs, so that stale grants do not leak data.
5. As a tester, I want the exact actor/environment/version, so that a screenshot cannot hide an incomplete lifecycle.

## Implementation Decisions

| Finding | Historical evidence | Planned seam | Closure evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| BUG-001 / PM-011 | cold invite acceptance intermittently blank | invitation acceptance + onboarding destination resolver | cold session, wrong-email/expired/revoked/retry, actual membership and landing |
| BUG-002 / PM-002 | org invite without intended Build access | atomic membership + module standing activation | accepted module member can create ordinary work in assigned project |
| BUG-003 | tester project membership gate | canonical project access | assigned vs unrelated project positive/negative; consistent discovery |
| BUG-004 | Member client access no CTA/denial | capability projection and access request | safe human explanation; no inappropriate grant management |
| BUG-005 / PM-001 | false-success client invite without grant/entry | PortalGrants create transaction/outbox | persisted row, usable entry, client real artifact, no false toast |
| BUG-006 | Grant Access project loader failure | scoped project queries | authorized projects list loads; empty/denied/network states differ |
| BUG-007 | contested/scrubbed observation in CI log | original evidence review before attribution | reproduce exact original condition; do not invent a fix from identifier |
| UX-022/023 | membership discovery and productive role mismatch | scoped projects + ticket commands | correct count/list; Member create/update; deny elsewhere |
| UX-024–032 | cycle/release/filter/program/triage/report/portal/form depth gaps | corresponding domain/query interfaces | filled lifecycle and negative cases, recorded in source-linked acceptance |
| RBAC/cache/DB deployment gaps | source design cannot prove target runtime | AuthContext + ScopedRead + project access + client policy | runtime-role DB isolation, cache revocation, job/export/file/AI negatives |

Do not expand a historical severity into a new release blocker without attribution. Do not call RBAC broken because a UI preset is restricted. Compare current catalog, intended role and observed behavior; findings remain verification work until reproduced.

## Testing Decisions

For every closure record: frontend/backend/worker revisions; environment and synthetic tenants; actor/principal and exact role/grant; initial state; action; persisted DB/API result; console/network; audit/outbox/job/cache evidence; unauthorized/cross-tenant negative; responsive path. Existing focused tests support closure but cannot substitute browser/persistence/deployment evidence.

Gate sequence: invite acceptance → module assignment → client grant. Then membership discovery/Member contribution → filters/current cycle → release/program links → usable triage/forms/reports. Advanced whiteboard/ops breadth stays Deferred.

## Out of Scope

Claiming any bug fixed by documentation or running destructive production tests. Missing target-environment proof stays open.

## Further Notes

Detailed authorization risks remain separately documented in [RBAC review](../governance/rbac/README.md). Evidence cleanup removes duplicate copies only, never the sole report supporting an open finding.

## Delivery checklist

Track completion in the [requirement ledger](../implementation/REQUIREMENT-LEDGER.md) and [work claims](../implementation/WORK-CLAIMS.md). An unchecked item stays open until evidence is recorded on the current branch.

- [x] Preserve the historical BUG/PM/UX chronology and map each named finding to a planned seam and closure evidence in [Implementation Decisions](#implementation-decisions) and [research traceability](./research-traceability.md#adopted-decisions-and-bug-hooks).
- [ ] Reproduce each open high-priority finding on a named current frontend/backend/worker revision, actor, tenant, and initial state; keep contested BUG-007 unattributed until its original condition is reviewed.
- [ ] Verify invite acceptance, Build standing, and client grant activation in that order with actual membership/grant rows, usable entry, retry, and wrong-identity/project negatives.
- [ ] Attach network/console, audit/outbox/cache, target DB, responsive, and unauthorized-role evidence before marking an individual bug closed.
