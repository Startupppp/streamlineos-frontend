## 🏁 Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (20+ recommended)
- **pnpm** (recommended, repo uses `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- Running **PostgreSQL** instance

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd vaivamm-crm
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

The project validates environment variables via `lib/env.ts`. Use `env.example` as the source of truth:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Then update at least:

- **Database**
  - `DATABASE_URL` — PostgreSQL connection string.
- **Auth**
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` — usually `http://localhost:3000` in development.
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` — generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- **Email**
  - `EMAIL_PROVIDER` — one of `sendgrid`, `smtp`, or `azure`.
  - `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`.
  - Provider-specific keys (e.g. `SENDGRID_API_KEY` or SMTP config).
- **Storage**
  - `R2_REGION`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_ENDPOINT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_URL`.
- **AI**
  - `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`.
- **App URLs**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` — typically `http://localhost:3000`.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_QR_REDIRECT_BASE_URL`.

> There is also a legacy `.env.example` file; `env.example` is the more complete template and is recommended for new setups.

### 4. Set up the database

Push the Drizzle schema to your local database:

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

Optional but recommended:

- **Generate migrations from schema**:

  ```bash
  pnpm db:generate
  ```

- **Apply migrations**:

  ```bash
  pnpm db:migrate
  ```

### 5. Seed data (optional)

To quickly explore the app with sample data, you can run the seed scripts:

```bash
# Base seed (organizations, roles, users, etc.)
pnpm tsx scripts/seed.ts

# Additional CRM-specific seed data
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-crm.ts

# Import regional holidays (optional)
pnpm tsx scripts/import-holidays.ts
```

Creating an initial organization can also be done via:

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/create-organization.ts
```

> Review each script before running in a non-local environment.

### 6. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## ✅ Production Considerations

- **Secrets**: Never commit `.env` files. Use your cloud provider’s secret manager or CI/CD secrets.
- **Database**: Run `db:generate` + `db:migrate` as part of your deployment pipeline instead of `db:push`.
- **Cron Routes**: Secure cron endpoints via `CRON_SECRET` and your scheduler (e.g. GitHub Actions, cloud cron).
- **Email**: Ensure domain verification and sender authentication (SPF/DKIM) with your email provider.
- **File Storage**: Configure R2 credentials and `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_URL` appropriately per environment.

## 🧩 Contributing / Customizing

This project is structured to be a strong starting point for a company-internal CRM/HR/Projects tool:

- Swap out providers (email, storage, AI) via environment variables.
- Extend Drizzle schema and tRPC routers under `lib/db/schema.ts` and `server/api`.
- Add or adjust permissions via `lib/rbac/permissions.ts` and `lib/rbac/middleware.ts`.

If you fork or customize it heavily, keep the environment validation in `lib/env.ts` in sync with your `.env` contract.
