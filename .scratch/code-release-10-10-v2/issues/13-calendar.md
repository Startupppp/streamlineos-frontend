# 13: Calendar

**What to build:** Recurrence, timezones, exceptions, attendees, reminders, provider synchronization, conflicts, and UI states remain correct under retry and drift.

**Blocked by:** 02 — Schema and executable-key minimization; 04 — API, Zod and OpenAPI contracts; 05 — Authentication, Organization, RBAC and Settings

**Status:** ready-for-agent

**Source:** `architecture-refactor/PRD-10-10-CODE-RELEASE-TODO.md`

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **PRD-C128** — Frontend/TanStack/tests: verify one `/calendar`, source toggles, timezone display, series-versus-instance edits, cursor/range keys and DST/exception/conflict/reminder E2E.
- [ ] **PRD-C129** — Commit Calendar changes locally first with an atomic provider-sync intent and `pending` state; process create/update/delete asynchronously with idempotent lease, retry/backoff and cancellation, persist per-event monotonic operation/version ordering plus delete tombstones, discard stale jobs/webhooks, reconcile provider drift, expose `synced/failed` plus user retry, and prevent permanent local/external divergence.

## Completion evidence

- Record applicable frontend/root and backend commit SHAs, commands, pass/fail/skip counts, and artifact locations.
- Update the source PRD checkbox states and the traceability manifest in the same completion commit.
